# The Claude on Foundry Starter Kit

> Short link: **<https://aka.ms/claude/start>**

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/claude?quickstart=1) [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/claude)

**Deploy [Claude](https://docs.claude.com/) (haiku, sonnet, opus) on [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/) in one command.** Then call it from the [Anthropic SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/client-sdks) and the [Claude Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-claude-code) CLI over Microsoft Entra ID &mdash; no API keys.

Ships in both **Bicep** and **Terraform**. Works in the cloud (GitHub Codespaces) or on your laptop.

![Architecture: azd up provisions a Foundry account, project, and Claude deployments; the postprovision hook configures the local workspace so the Python SDK and Claude Code CLI both call the deployment via Entra ID.](./docs/img/architecture.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By running `azd up` you accept Anthropic's commercial terms for Claude. Three short attestation fields (`CLAUDE_ORGANIZATION_NAME`, `CLAUDE_COUNTRY_CODE`, `CLAUDE_INDUSTRY`) are sent to Anthropic with every request and must match your real organization. **[Read the Terms of use](#terms-of-use) before you deploy.**

<details id="terms-of-use">
<summary><strong>Important &mdash; please read: Terms of use</strong></summary>

The Terraform and Bicep in this template both send a `modelProviderData` block (`organizationName`, `countryCode`, `industry`) with each Claude deployment. The Cognitive Services RP uses that block to **auto-sign the Azure Marketplace offer for Anthropic Claude on your behalf** &mdash; no manual click-through. Before deploying, please:

1. Read the legal docs that govern your use of Claude via Microsoft Foundry:
   - [Anthropic Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) &mdash; the master agreement for business / enterprise use (Foundry requires an Enterprise or MCA-E subscription).
   - [Anthropic Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup) (also called the Acceptable Use Policy / AUP) &mdash; incorporated by reference into the Commercial Terms and the doc Microsoft Foundry's own [Responsible AI guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude#responsible-ai-considerations) points to.
   - [Anthropic Supported Regions Policy](https://aka.ms/supported_anthropic_regions) &mdash; also incorporated by reference; controls which regions are eligible.
   - [Microsoft Product Terms](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/) for Azure.
2. **Update the three attestation fields so they accurately describe your organization** &mdash; see the highlighted rows in [All configuration variables](#all-configuration-variables):
   - `CLAUDE_ORGANIZATION_NAME` (no default &mdash; required)
   - `CLAUDE_COUNTRY_CODE` (default `US`)
   - `CLAUDE_INDUSTRY` (default `technology`)

   These values are sent to Anthropic on every request and are part of your acceptance &mdash; they should match the real legal entity, country of operation, and industry that will use the model.
3. Confirm your Azure subscription is [eligible to deploy Anthropic models in Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude#prerequisites).

<details>
<summary>Preview the dialog Foundry would show on the manual path, and audit acceptance after <code>azd up</code></summary>

The exact "Agree and proceed" dialog the Azure portal renders for a Claude SKU is generated live from the Marketplace offer metadata (Microsoft template + publisher-supplied links). It can change without notice, so this README does not snapshot its text &mdash; instead, open the live marketplace listing for the SKU you plan to deploy:

- Sonnet 4.6 &mdash; <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/anthropic.anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6-offer>
- Opus 4.6 &mdash; <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/anthropic.anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-offer>
- Haiku 4.5 &mdash; <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/anthropic.anthropic-claude-haiku-4-5-offer>
- All Anthropic offers &mdash; <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=anthropic>

After `azd up`, you can audit the auto-signed marketplace agreement record from the CLI (returns metadata only &mdash; `accepted`, `signature`, signed-by, date, `licenseTextLink` &mdash; not the dialog text):

```bash
az term show \
  --publisher anthropic \
  --product anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6-offer \
  --plan <plan-name>
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Prerequisites</strong> &mdash; an Azure subscription with Claude entitlement, plus <code>az</code> + <code>azd</code> (or just open in Codespaces)</summary>

- An Azure subscription [eligible to deploy Claude in Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude#prerequisites), with `Contributor` on the target subscription/resource group (see [Required permissions](#required-permissions) for the full breakdown, including the data-plane role you need to call the model).
- Region: `eastus2` or `swedencentral` host all three Claude families (haiku / sonnet / opus). `westus2` is sonnet + opus only.
- Tools: [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), [azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd), Python &ge; 3.10, and [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) &ge; 1.6 (Terraform variant only). **Or just open the repo in GitHub Codespaces / VS Code Dev Containers** &mdash; the included [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) preinstalls `az`, `azd`, and Python 3.13 for you.
- Run `az login` once (in addition to `azd auth login`). The `preprovision` hook uses `az` to validate that each requested Claude SKU exists in the Anthropic-on-Foundry catalog and that you have enough TPM quota in the chosen region. If `az` isn't installed or signed in, the hook warns and skips those checks so `azd up` still works &mdash; you just lose the proactive error messages.

## Quickstart

Three ways to deploy &mdash; pick whichever feels most welcoming.

### 1. Zero-touch in GitHub Codespaces (no local install)

<a id="quickstart-in-codespaces"></a>

The fastest way to try this. Everything runs in your browser &mdash; nothing to install locally.

1. [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/claude?quickstart=1) &mdash; click to launch (or use the green **Code** button on GitHub &rarr; **Codespaces** &rarr; **Create codespace on main**). The container builds in ~2 min the first time.
2. When the terminal is ready, sign in to Azure with device-code (the browser flow works inside a Codespace):

   ```bash
   az login --use-device-code
   azd auth login --use-device-code
   ```

3. Pick a variant and deploy:

   ```bash
   cd infra-bicep   # or: cd infra-terraform
   azd env new my-claude
   azd env set CLAUDE_ORGANIZATION_NAME "Contoso"
   azd env set AZURE_LOCATION "swedencentral"
   azd env set CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL "claude-sonnet-4-6"
   azd up
   ```

4. When `azd up` finishes, jump to [Use Claude](#use-claude) below.

> **Prefer the Dev Container on your laptop?** Click the **Dev Containers** badge at the top of this README, or install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and run *"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"* on the cloned repo. Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### 2. Ask an AI agent

This repo ships an open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) playbook. Any assistant that reads [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) &mdash; GitHub Copilot Chat, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Amp, Goose, and friends &mdash; onboards you in plain English.

**Copy this into GitHub Copilot Chat (or your AI agent) inside the cloned repo:**

> Deploy Claude on Microsoft Foundry using this repo. Use **Bicep**, region **eastus2**, model **claude-sonnet-4-6**, organization name **Contoso**.

That's the full one-shot &mdash; just swap the bolded values to suit you. Optional additions:

- *"&hellip;also deploy **haiku** and **opus**"* &mdash; multi-family deployment in one shot.
- *"&hellip;country **GB**, industry **finance**"* &mdash; if your org isn't US tech (defaults are `US` / `technology`).
- *"&hellip;with **`ASSIGN_RBAC=true`**"* &mdash; also grant yourself the least-privilege inference role.
- *"&hellip;install Claude Code automatically"* &mdash; sets `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_INSTALL=true`.

The agent then follows the playbook in [`skills/claude-on-foundry/SKILL.md`](./skills/claude-on-foundry/SKILL.md) and the always-on rules in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) &mdash; using this repo's scripts, env-var contract, region matrix, and error catalog instead of guessing. It confirms with you before any destructive action.

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent setup</strong> &mdash; how the skill loads in different assistants, plus more example prompts</summary>

Already cloned and in a workspace? Your agent picks the skill up automatically &mdash; just open the repo in your preferred assistant. GitHub Copilot reads [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) natively; others follow [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

To add the skill to a different workspace:

```bash
npx skills add Azure-Samples/claude
```

More example prompts you can also try:

- *"Why is `azd up` failing with `715-123420`?"*
- *"Free up quota held by soft-deleted accounts in `swedencentral`."*
- *"Verify Claude Code is wired up to my Foundry deployment."*
- *"Tear it all down cleanly."*

</details>

### 3. Locally with `azd up`

Already have `az` + `azd` installed? Skip Codespaces and run it locally.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/claude.git
cd claude/infra-bicep   # or: cd claude/infra-terraform

# If your Claude-eligible subscription lives in a non-default tenant, pass --tenant-id:
azd auth login          # or: azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>

azd env new my-claude
azd env set CLAUDE_ORGANIZATION_NAME "Contoso"
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION "swedencentral"
azd env set CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL "claude-sonnet-4-6"
azd up
```

That's it. To deploy other families, tweak capacity, or change attestation, see [Choosing which models to deploy](#choosing-which-models-to-deploy) and [All configuration variables](#all-configuration-variables) in Advanced.

## Use Claude

### Python SDK

The Python sample is the primary hello-world path. It calls your Foundry-hosted Claude deployment with Microsoft Entra ID &mdash; no API key.

```powershell
# from infra-bicep/ or infra-terraform/ (so `azd env get-values` works).
# Use Out-File so the file is UTF-8 (Windows PowerShell 5.1's `>` writes UTF-16, which python-dotenv mis-parses).
azd env get-values | Out-File -Encoding utf8 ..\.env.local
# macOS/Linux: azd env get-values > ../.env.local

cd ..
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1   # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/hello_claude.py                  # one-shot Messages call (Entra ID)
python src/chat_stream.py                   # interactive streaming chat &mdash; type a message, `exit` to quit
python src/hello_claude_token_refresh.py    # long-running variant with per-request token refresh
```

<details>
<summary><strong>SDK call shape</strong> &mdash; the minimal Python snippet and long-running token refresh</summary>

We use the plain `anthropic.Anthropic` client. The Entra ID token is captured once at startup and is valid for ~1 hour &mdash; fine for a one-shot script or a short-lived process. For long-running processes, use the token-refresh shim below.

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

token = DefaultAzureCredential().get_token(
    "https://ai.azure.com/.default"
).token
client = Anthropic(
    auth_token=token,
    base_url="https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic",
)
msg = client.messages.create(
    model="<deployment-name>",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}],
)
```

> Pass the **deployment name** (not the model id) as `model`. The SDK appends `/v1/messages` to the configured `base_url`.

<details id="advanced-long-running-processes-auto-refreshing-the-entra-id-token">
<summary><strong>Long-running processes: auto-refreshing the Entra ID token</strong></summary>

The plain `anthropic.Anthropic` client only accepts `auth_token: str | None`, so a captured token will start failing with `401 Unauthorized` after ~1 hour.

For services, daemons, long batch jobs, or notebooks left open, use [src/hello_claude_token_refresh.py](./src/hello_claude_token_refresh.py). It defines a tiny `AnthropicIdentity(Anthropic)` subclass that overrides the `auth_token` property to call `azure.identity.get_bearer_token_provider(...)` per request, giving free per-request token refresh:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
# AnthropicIdentity is defined in hello_claude_token_refresh.py
from hello_claude_token_refresh import AnthropicIdentity

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://ai.azure.com/.default"
)
client = AnthropicIdentity(
    azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
    base_url="https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic",
)
```

If the Anthropic SDK ever accepts a callable for `auth_token`, this shim becomes unnecessary.

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code CLI</strong> &mdash; optional agentic CLI against the same deployment</summary>

After `azd up` finishes, the postprovision hook writes a project-scoped activator file. Source it once per shell:

```powershell
. ./claude-code.env.ps1     # PowerShell. macOS/Linux: source ./claude-code.env.sh
```

```powershell
claude                       # interactive REPL
'who are you?' | claude -p   # one-shot prompt
```

If `claude` isn't installed, the postprovision hook printed the one-line installer command. Or set `azd env set CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_INSTALL true` before `azd up` to install it automatically.

</details>

### Verify the wiring

One command runs every config check plus a live `claude -p` round trip per deployed family:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/verify-claude-code.ps1
# macOS/Linux: bash scripts/verify-claude-code.sh
```

Exits non-zero on any failure &mdash; safe to wire into CI. Use `-SkipClaudeCall` for config-only checks (no token cost), or `-RunPythonSample` to also run the Python Entra ID round trip. For the manual breakdown of what the script does, see [Verify Claude Code is wired up &mdash; manual checks](#verify-claude-code-is-wired-up) in Advanced.

## Advanced

Everything below is opt-in. The quickstart above is enough to get a working Claude deployment.

<details>
<summary><strong>Cleanup / tear down</strong> &mdash; remove Azure resources and release quota</summary>

<a id="tear-down"></a>

When you're done, free the resources *and* the TPM quota:

```powershell
cd infra-bicep   # or: cd infra-terraform &mdash; whichever you deployed
azd down --force --purge
```

The `--purge` flag immediately releases the Foundry account from soft-delete; otherwise its TPM quota stays reserved for up to 48 h. If you didn't pass `--purge` and need to reclaim quota manually, see [Free quota held by soft-deleted accounts](#free-quota-held-by-soft-deleted-accounts).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Choosing which models to deploy</strong> &mdash; haiku / sonnet / opus, capacity, catalog</summary>

<a id="choosing-which-models-to-deploy"></a>

Set one, two, or all three of `CLAUDE_HAIKU_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL` &mdash; each non-empty value deploys that family into the same Foundry account. The postprovision hook writes one `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_<FAMILY>_MODEL` env var per deployed family into the activator + `.vscode/settings.json`, so Claude Code can route across all three.

| Goal | Set |
|---|---|
| All three families (recommended) | `CLAUDE_HAIKU_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5`, `CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6`, `CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL=claude-opus-4-8` |
| Just sonnet | `CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6` (leave the others unset) |
| Just opus | `CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL=claude-opus-4-8` (or an earlier `-4-x` if quota is tight) |
| Single legacy model (back-compat) | `CLAUDE_MODEL_NAME=...` and leave all `CLAUDE_*_MODEL` vars empty |

Override capacity per family with `CLAUDE_HAIKU_CAPACITY` / `CLAUDE_SONNET_CAPACITY` / `CLAUDE_OPUS_CAPACITY` (TPM &divide; 1000, default `25` each).

Run [`./Get-ClaudeCatalog.ps1`](./Get-ClaudeCatalog.ps1) to see the live catalog and pick model versions matching your region:

```powershell
./Get-ClaudeCatalog.ps1            # compact table: model, version, regions, context, capacity, retirement date
./Get-ClaudeCatalog.ps1 -Latest    # just the newest generation per family
```

</details>

<details id="configuration">
<summary><strong>All configuration variables</strong> &mdash; attestation, region, capacity, RBAC, hooks</summary>

<a id="all-configuration-variables"></a>

Rows marked **Attest** below are the three `modelProviderData` fields sent to Anthropic and used by the marketplace RP to auto-sign the [Anthropic Commercial Terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms) (which incorporate the [Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/aup) and [Supported Regions Policy](https://aka.ms/supported_anthropic_regions) by reference) on your behalf &mdash; see the [Terms of use](#terms-of-use) above. Set them to match your real organization.

| `CLAUDE_WRITE_VSCODE_SETTINGS` | no | `false` | `true` to opt in to having the postprovision hook write `.vscode/settings.json` for the [Claude Code VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code). Default skips it &mdash; the CLI / SDK don't need workspace settings. |

</details>

<details id="claude-code-post-deploy-setup">
<summary><strong>Claude Code post-deploy setup</strong> &mdash; what the postprovision hook does</summary>

After `azd up` succeeds, the **postprovision** hook ([`scripts/configure-claude-code.ps1`](./scripts/configure-claude-code.ps1), with [`configure-claude-code.sh`](./scripts/configure-claude-code.sh) as a POSIX fallback) configures [Claude Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-claude-code) for the freshly-deployed Foundry resource. It does four things:

1. Writes a project-scoped activator at the repo root (`claude-code.env.ps1` and `claude-code.env.sh`, both gitignored) containing the [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-claude-code?tabs=bash#configure-claude-code-for-foundry) Claude Code expects:
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1`
   - `ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE=<your-foundry-account-name>`
   - One `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_<FAMILY>_MODEL=<deployment-name>` per deployed family (`HAIKU` / `SONNET` / `OPUS`). Only the families you actually deployed get a line.
   - **`AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=<repo>/.azure-cli`** &mdash; scopes `az login` (and `azd`) to this workspace only. See [Workspace-scoped `az login`](#workspace-scoped-az-login) below.
2. **(Opt-in)** Writes (or merges into) `.vscode/settings.json` with `claudeCode.environmentVariables` (the array-of-`{name,value}` schema the extension actually reads &mdash; the display name in the Settings UI is *"Claude Code: Environment Variables"*) and `claudeCode.disableLoginPrompt: true` so the [Claude Code VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) skips the Anthropic-account login and uses your Foundry deployment via Entra ID. It also sets `terminal.integrated.env.{windows,linux,osx}.AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` so every terminal VS Code spawns in this workspace inherits the scoped Azure config automatically &mdash; you don't even have to source the activator first. **This step only runs if you ask for it** &mdash; the hook leaves `.vscode/settings.json` alone by default since most users run Claude from the SDK, the Claude Code CLI (which only needs the activator at step 1), or another OpenAI-compatible client. **Using the Claude Code extension?** Opt in before `azd up` with `azd env set CLAUDE_WRITE_VSCODE_SETTINGS 1` (or pass `-WriteVsCodeSettings` / `--write-vscode-settings` when running the script standalone).
3. Writes (or merges into) `.claude/settings.json` at the repo root with `{ "model": "<family>" }` pinned to a deployed family (sonnet &gt; opus &gt; haiku priority). This is the **workspace-level** Claude Code config and overrides whatever is in your user-global `~/.claude/settings.json` &mdash; so bare `claude` / `claude -p` resolves to a family you actually deployed, even if your global default points elsewhere.
4. Checks whether `claude` is on PATH. If not, prints the platform-appropriate one-liner install command. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_INSTALL=true` *before* `azd up` to run [the official installer](https://claude.ai/install.ps1) automatically.

Authentication uses Microsoft Entra ID through your existing `az login` session &mdash; no API keys to manage. If the Foundry resource lives in a non-default tenant, run `az login --tenant <tenant-id>` first so the [token tenant matches the resource tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-claude-code?tabs=bash#troubleshooting).

To run Claude Code in a fresh shell at any time:

```powershell
. ./claude-code.env.ps1    # PowerShell. macOS/Linux: source ./claude-code.env.sh
claude /status             # verify "API provider: Microsoft Foundry"
```

You can also re-run the hook standalone:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/configure-claude-code.ps1
# or:
bash scripts/configure-claude-code.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Workspace-scoped <code>az login</code></strong> &mdash; how credentials stay inside this repo</summary>

<a id="workspace-scoped-az-login"></a>

Both the activators and `.vscode/settings.json` set `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=<repo>/.azure-cli` so that any `az login` (or `azd auth login`) you do here writes its token cache and config to **`./.azure-cli/`** inside the repo &mdash; never to the global `~/.azure`. The benefits:

- Other VS Code windows / shells keep their own existing `~/.azure` login (different tenant, different account &mdash; whatever) and are not affected.
- Logging out (`az logout`) or `rm -rf .azure-cli` only nukes this workspace's credentials.
- The directory is gitignored, so credentials never reach the repo.

VS Code applies the env var automatically to any terminal it opens inside this folder. If you launch a terminal outside VS Code, source the activator first (`. ./claude-code.env.ps1` or `source ./claude-code.env.sh`) before running `az login`. Verify with `az config get core` &mdash; the `config_path` should point inside the repo.

</details>

<details id="verify-claude-code-is-wired-up">
<summary><strong>Verify Claude Code is wired up &mdash; manual checks</strong></summary>

Four ways to confirm the CLI is talking to your fresh Foundry deployment, easiest first.

**0. One-command end-to-end check** &mdash; runs every check in this section plus an SDK round trip in one shot:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/verify-claude-code.ps1                    # all checks + claude -p per deployed family
pwsh -File scripts/verify-claude-code.ps1 -SkipClaudeCall    # config checks only (no token cost)
pwsh -File scripts/verify-claude-code.ps1 -RunPythonSample   # also runs python src/hello_claude.py
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-claude-code.sh                       # default
bash scripts/verify-claude-code.sh --skip-claude-call    # config only
bash scripts/verify-claude-code.sh --run-python-sample   # adds the Python Entra ID round trip
```

The verify script checks the activator file, env vars, `.vscode/settings.json` shape, `az` login + tenant, `claude` on PATH (with `-AutoInstall` / `--auto-install` to install it if missing), then runs a non-interactive `claude -p` per deployed family. Exits non-zero on any hard failure so you can wire it into CI.

The rest of this section is the same checks broken out manually.

**1. One-shot prompt (non-interactive)** &mdash; fastest manual check:

```powershell
. ./claude-code.env.ps1
'who are you?' | claude -p
```

You should see a one-line reply that identifies the deployed model (e.g. *"I'm Claude Sonnet 4.6, built by Anthropic."*). macOS/Linux:

```bash
source ./claude-code.env.sh
echo 'who are you?' | claude -p
```

**2. Interactive REPL** &mdash; the normal way to use it:

```powershell
. ./claude-code.env.ps1
claude
```

Useful slash commands once inside:

| Command | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `/status` | API provider (should say **Microsoft Foundry**), deployment name |
| `/model`  | Confirms the Anthropic family wired up |
| `/help`   | Full command list |

**3. VS Code extension** &mdash; install once, picks up `.vscode/settings.json` automatically:

```powershell
code --install-extension anthropic.claude-code
```

Then open the Command Palette &rarr; **"Claude Code: Start"** (or click the Claude icon in the activity bar). No extra config is needed &mdash; the postprovision hook already populated `claudeCode.environmentVariables` and `claudeCode.disableLoginPrompt` in [.vscode/settings.json](./.vscode/settings.json).

> **Still seeing a "Sign in to Claude" prompt?** Reload the window (Command Palette &rarr; **"Developer: Reload Window"**) so the extension re-reads `.vscode/settings.json`. If you used an older version of the hook that wrote a `"Claude Code: Environment Variables"` key, just re-run `pwsh -File scripts/configure-claude-code.ps1` &mdash; it strips the stale key and writes the correct `claudeCode.environmentVariables` schema.

> **Auth error?** If you see `401` / `Token tenant doesn't match resource tenant`, refresh your Azure login against the right tenant:
> ```powershell
> az login --tenant <tenant-id>   # the tenant that owns the Foundry resource
> ```

> **Multi-family support.** Set any combination of `CLAUDE_HAIKU_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL` and the template deploys each family as a sibling deployment under the same Foundry account. The hook writes one `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_<FAMILY>_MODEL` per deployed family into the activator + `.vscode/settings.json` automatically. See [Choosing which models to deploy](#choosing-which-models-to-deploy).

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: API-key auth (dev/test only)</strong></summary>

If you don't have a data-plane role on the Foundry account yet, you can run a quick check with an API key. Prefer Entra ID for anything beyond local testing &mdash; keys can't be scoped per-user and rotate manually.

```powershell
# FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT_NAME and AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP are emitted by `azd env get-values`
$env:CLAUDE_API_KEY = (az cognitiveservices account keys list `
    --name $env:FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT_NAME `
    --resource-group $env:AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --query key1 -o tsv)
python src/hello_claude_apikey.py
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What gets deployed</strong></summary>

- **Microsoft Foundry** account (`Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts`, kind `AIServices`, SKU `S0`, `allowProjectManagement = true`)
- **Foundry project**
- One **Claude deployment per requested family** (`GlobalStandard`, with the required `modelProviderData` block) &mdash; set `CLAUDE_HAIKU_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_SONNET_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_OPUS_MODEL` to control which families. Sonnet/Opus deployments chain on the prior to avoid Foundry's per-account 409s on concurrent create.
- *Optional* RBAC: a single `Cognitive Services User` assignment on the Foundry account for the deploying principal (set `ASSIGN_RBAC=true`). This is the [least-privilege role the MS Learn doc recommends](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-entra-id?tabs=python&pivots=ai-foundry-portal#for-making-authenticated-api-calls) for keyless inference &mdash; it grants exactly the `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/MaaS/*` data action this template's runtime needs and nothing else. If you want broader access (project-scoped APIs, agents, etc.), grant `Foundry User` or `Azure AI Developer` yourself afterwards &mdash; see the [permissions matrix](#required-permissions) below.
  - **Heads up:** without this (or a manual post-deploy grant), the Python SDK and `claude` CLI will return `401 PermissionDenied` even though `azd up` succeeded. See [Granting data-plane roles after `azd up`](#granting-data-plane-roles-after-azd-up).
  - When `ASSIGN_RBAC=true`, the model deployments are ordered to run *after* the role assignment. The role-assignment PUT returns fast (~5 s) but Foundry data-plane RBAC takes a few minutes to propagate; the slow model-deployment LRO (30 s&ndash;20 min) absorbs that propagation time so the first call after `azd up` succeeds without retries.

<a id="granting-data-plane-roles-after-azd-up"></a>

**Granting data-plane roles after `azd up`** (one-liner if you own RBAC on the Foundry account):

```powershell
$acct = (azd env get-value FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT_NAME)
$rg   = (azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)
$oid  = (az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
$scope = "/subscriptions/$(az account show --query id -o tsv)/resourceGroups/$rg/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/$acct"
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id $oid --assignee-principal-type User --role "Cognitive Services User" --scope $scope
```

POSIX equivalent:

```bash

rg=$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)
oid=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
scope="/subscriptions/$(az account show --query id -o tsv)/resourceGroups/$rg/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/$acct"
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id "$oid" --assignee-principal-type User --role "Cognitive Services User" --scope "$scope"
```

Wait 1&ndash;3 minutes for the role to propagate to the Foundry data plane before retrying &mdash; see the [intermittent 401 troubleshooting row](#troubleshooting).

**Roles that work for Claude inference:**

| Role | Data action(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Cognitive Services User` | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/*/read` + inference action | The minimum role recommended by [the official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-entra-id?tabs=python&pivots=ai-foundry-portal#for-making-authenticated-api-calls), and what this template assigns when `ASSIGN_RBAC=true`. GUID `a97b65f3-24c7-4388-baec-2e87135dc908`. |
| `Foundry User` | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/*` | Broader data-plane access; useful if you plan to add project-scoped samples (agents, knowledge, evaluators) on top of this template. **Previously named `Azure AI User`** &mdash; Azure renamed it, GUID `53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d` is unchanged. |
| `Azure AI Developer` | includes `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/MaaS/*` | Sufficient for Claude because Claude routes through the **MaaS** data path as a partner/marketplace model. (It is **not** sufficient for first-party Foundry models that route through `accounts/AIServices/*`.) |

> The role `Azure AI Developer` was historically called out as *insufficient* for Foundry inference. That guidance still applies to first-party `AIServices` models, but Claude/Anthropic deployments dispatch through `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/MaaS/*`, which `Azure AI Developer` already grants. Verified against `claude-sonnet-4-6` on `2025-10-01-preview`.

<details id="preprovision-preflight-marketplace-catalog--quota">
<summary><strong>Preprovision preflight: Marketplace catalog &amp; quota</strong></summary>

Both IaC variants run [`scripts/preflight-claude.ps1`](./scripts/preflight-claude.ps1) (with [`preflight-claude.sh`](./scripts/preflight-claude.sh) as a POSIX fallback) from the `preprovision` hook in `azure.yaml`, to give you a fast, descriptive error for the most common misconfigurations before `azd up` calls the Cognitive Services RP.

What the preflight does, and does not, do:

| Check | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_ORGANIZATION_NAME` / `AZURE_LOCATION` set | Hard fail (exit 1) if missing. |
| Marketplace offer/plan resolves | Hard fail (exit 4) on 400 "offer not found" &mdash; catches `CLAUDE_MODEL_NAME` typos and unreleased SKUs. The script queries publisher `anthropic` with offer/plan naming `anthropic-<model-name>-offer` / `anthropic-<model-name>-plan-new`. |
| Marketplace agreement `properties.accepted == true` | Warns only. The Cognitive Services RP auto-signs the agreement during deployment on eligible subs, so an unsigned status is informational. Pre-accept manually if your sub blocks RP-initiated subscribes. |
| `az cognitiveservices usage list` quota headroom for the SKU | **Hard fail (exit 6)** if `currentValue + requested > limit`. This is the most common cause of deployment failures and the preflight blocks `azd up` early with an actionable message. |

> **Why a quota check?** The Cognitive Services RP returns an opaque `400 715-123420 "An error occurred. Please reach out to support for additional assistance."` when there isn't enough TPM quota for the requested capacity. Worse, Terraform's `azapi_resource` skips ARM preflight validation, so the user sees this opaque code with no hint that quota is the cause. (Bicep / `az deployment group create` surface the real `InsufficientQuota` error.) The preflight catches the same condition before the deployment is even attempted, with a clear message and remediation instructions.

Run it standalone any time:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_ORGANIZATION_NAME = "Contoso"
$env:AZURE_LOCATION = "eastus2"
$env:CLAUDE_MODEL_NAME = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
$env:CLAUDE_SONNET_CAPACITY = "25"   # default 25; lower further if quota is tight
pwsh -File scripts/preflight-claude.ps1
```

If the quota check fails, see what's used:

```powershell
az cognitiveservices usage list -l eastus2 --query "[?contains(name.value,'claude-sonnet-4-6')].{quota:name.value, used:currentValue, limit:limit}" -o table
```

To list all Anthropic agreements (signed or not) visible on the active subscription:

```powershell
$sub = az account show --query id -o tsv
az rest --method get --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$sub/providers/Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/agreements?api-version=2021-01-01" --query "value[?properties.publisher=='anthropic']"
```

To pre-accept explicitly (rarely needed thanks to the RP auto-accept; useful for restricted-subscription scenarios):

```powershell
az term accept --publisher anthropic --product anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6-offer --plan anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-6-plan-new
```

</details>

<details id="advanced-check-claude-quota--capacity-programmatically">
<summary><strong>Check Claude quota &amp; capacity programmatically</strong></summary>

[`src/check_claude_quota.py`](./src/check_claude_quota.py) queries the Azure Resource Manager APIs documented for Foundry quota &mdash; the [Usages API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/openai/how-to/quota?tabs=python#programmatically-check-quota-and-capacity) and the Model Capacities API &mdash; and prints a single merged table keyed on `(model, region)` with TPM utilization, derived RPM limits, deployable capacity, and model version.

Requirements:

- Caller authenticated via `az login` / `azd auth login` (or any other `DefaultAzureCredential` source).
- `Cognitive Services Usages Reader` (or `Reader`) at subscription scope. Without it, the calls return `403`.
- The subscription must be Enterprise or MCA-E for Claude quota lines to appear (per the [official prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude#prerequisites)).

Run it:

```powershell
python src/check_claude_quota.py                                    # current subscription, default regions
python src/check_claude_quota.py --regions eastus2 swedencentral    # explicit regions
python src/check_claude_quota.py --subscription <sub-id> --tenant <tenant-id>
python src/check_claude_quota.py --json                             # machine-readable
```

Flags:

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--subscription` | current `az` subscription / `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Subscription to query. |
| `--tenant` | caller's home tenant | Use when the subscription lives in a different tenant. Auth chain becomes `AzureCliCredential` + `AzureDeveloperCliCredential` scoped to that tenant. |
| `--regions` | `eastus2 swedencentral` | Regions to query for usages. |
| `--models` | all known Claude models | Filter capacity lookup. |
| `--json` | off | Emit raw JSON instead of the merged table. |

Notes on the output:

- **RPM is not a separate quota line** in the Usages API for Claude &mdash; only TPM is allocated. The `RPM Limit*` column is **derived** from the per-model RPM:TPM ratios published in the [Foundry Claude docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude#api-quotas-and-limits) (e.g. Sonnet 4.5 ships at 2 RPM per 1 kTPM; everything else at 1:1).
- **TPM Limit values are reported in thousands** by the underlying API; the script multiplies by 1,000 so the table reads in raw tokens-per-minute.
- The **Model Capacities API requires `modelVersion`**, not just `modelName`. The script discovers active versions automatically from `locations/{region}/models` filtered to `format=Anthropic`.
- The `Def RPM` / `Def TPM` columns are the **public non-EA defaults** (always 0/0 because Claude is gated to Enterprise + MCA-E subscriptions); the `TPM Used` / `TPM Limit` / `RPM Limit*` / `Capacity` columns are the values your EA/MCA-E subscription is actually getting.

</details>

<details id="free-quota-held-by-soft-deleted-accounts">
<summary><strong>Free quota held by soft-deleted Cognitive Services accounts</strong></summary>

When you `azd down` (or otherwise delete) a Foundry / AIServices account, Azure does **not** immediately release the TPM quota it reserved. The account moves to a *soft-deleted* state and **continues to count against your per-model quota** for up to 48 hours, after which it is permanently purged automatically.

In day-to-day testing &mdash; where you may create and destroy several Foundry accounts in the same region in quick succession &mdash; this is the most common cause of "quota looks full but I have no live deployments" failures (which surface as opaque `715-123420` from Terraform or `InsufficientQuota` from Bicep).

**List soft-deleted accounts in the active subscription:**

```powershell
az cognitiveservices account list-deleted --query "[].{name:name, location:location, deletionDate:properties.deletionDate}" -o table
```

**Purge them one at a time** (the original RG name is part of the deleted-account id and must be passed verbatim &mdash; the RG itself does not have to still exist):

```powershell
az cognitiveservices account purge `
  --name <account-name> `
  --location <region> `
  --resource-group <original-rg-name>
```

**Purge all of them in parallel** (faster &mdash; each purge is a slow LRO):

```powershell
$accounts = az cognitiveservices account list-deleted -o json | ConvertFrom-Json
$jobs = foreach ($a in $accounts) {
    $rg = ($a.id -split '/')[8]   # /subscriptions/<sub>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/locations/<loc>/resourceGroups/<rg>/deletedAccounts/<name>
    Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
        param($n,$l,$r)
        az cognitiveservices account purge --name $n --location $l --resource-group $r
    } -ArgumentList $a.name, $a.location, $rg
}
$jobs | Wait-Job | Receive-Job
$jobs | Remove-Job
```

POSIX equivalent:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account list-deleted -o tsv \
  --query "[].[name, location, id]" | while IFS=$'\t' read -r name location id; do
    rg=$(echo "$id" | awk -F'/' '{print $9}')
    az cognitiveservices account purge --name "$name" --location "$location" --resource-group "$rg" &
done
wait
```

After all purges complete, re-check quota:

```powershell
az cognitiveservices usage list -l <region> --query "[?contains(name.value,'claude-')]" -o table
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why <code>modelProviderData</code> matters</strong></summary>

Claude deployments fail with `AnthropicOrganizationCreationException` if `modelProviderData` is missing. **`industry` must be lowercase** to match the Foundry portal dropdown.

The Terraform variant uses `azapi_resource` for both the Foundry account and the Claude deployment, because the native `azurerm_cognitive_account` / `azurerm_cognitive_deployment` resources do not yet expose `allowProjectManagement` or `modelProviderData` ([tracked here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/31140)). The Bicep variant uses native resources at API version `2025-10-01-preview`, which support both.

</details>

<details id="troubleshooting">
<summary><strong>Troubleshooting: common errors and fixes</strong></summary>

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `AnthropicOrganizationCreationException` / `AnthropicOrganizationCreationFailed` | `modelProviderData` is missing or malformed. Ensure all three of `organizationName`, `countryCode`, `industry` are set, and that `industry` is lowercase. |
| `Project can only be created under AIServices Kind account with allowProjectManagement set to true` | Account property missing. Both variants here set it; check you didn't downgrade the API version. |
| `404 Not Found` on inference | Base URL must end in `/anthropic` &mdash; `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic`. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Token scope must be `https://ai.azure.com/.default`. Re-run `az login`. |
| `401 Unauthorized` after ~1 hour of running | The Entra ID token captured at startup has expired. The plain `Anthropic` client doesn't auto-refresh &mdash; see the [long-running token refresh shim](#advanced-long-running-processes-auto-refreshing-the-entra-id-token) for [src/hello_claude_token_refresh.py](./src/hello_claude_token_refresh.py), which uses an `AnthropicIdentity` shim to refresh per request. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Missing a data-plane role on the Foundry account. Grant `Cognitive Services User`, `Foundry User` (formerly `Azure AI User`), or `Azure AI Developer` (see [Required permissions](#required-permissions)). |
| `Region not available` | Deploy to `eastus2` or `swedencentral` (or `westus2` for opus-only). |
| Subscription can't deploy Claude | Confirm subscription eligibility per the [official docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude#prerequisites). The [preprovision preflight](#preprovision-preflight-marketplace-catalog--quota) warns about this before `azd up` calls the RP. |
| `Error occurred when subscribing to Marketplace: Marketplace Subscription purchase eligibility check failed` | Your subscription cannot purchase the Anthropic offer (no entitlement, sandbox sub, paid-offer policy denial, etc.). Either use a subscription with Claude-on-Foundry entitlement, or pre-accept the agreement explicitly with `az term accept --publisher anthropic --product anthropic-<model>-offer --plan anthropic-<model>-plan-new`. |
| Opaque `400 715-123420 "An error occurred. Please reach out to support for additional assistance."` on the Terraform deployment step (RG / Foundry account / project all succeed) | **Insufficient quota.** Terraform's `azapi_resource` bypasses ARM preflight validation and the Cognitive Services RP returns this generic code instead of `InsufficientQuota`. **Fix:** check `az cognitiveservices usage list -l <region> --query "[?contains(name.value,'<model>')]"` &mdash; if `currentValue + requestedCapacity > limit`, lower `CLAUDE_SONNET_CAPACITY` / `CLAUDE_HAIKU_CAPACITY` / `CLAUDE_OPUS_CAPACITY` via `azd env set`, delete unused deployments to free capacity, or request a quota increase in the Foundry portal. **Also check for soft-deleted accounts** still holding quota &mdash; see [Free quota held by soft-deleted accounts](#free-quota-held-by-soft-deleted-accounts). To confirm it really is quota, re-run on the Bicep variant which surfaces the clearer `InsufficientQuota` error. |
| Bicep: `InsufficientQuota: This operation require N new capacity in quota Tokens Per Minute (thousands) - Claude <model>, which is bigger than the current available capacity X. The current quota usage is U and the quota limit is L.` | Same root cause as `715-123420` above, just with a clear message because Bicep goes through ARM preflight. Lower the capacity env var(s) or free up quota. |
| `GatewayTimeout: The gateway did not receive a response from 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices' within the specified time period.` during the model deployment step, often with the deployment stuck in `Creating` | **ARM-layer poll timeout on a slow long-running operation, not a real failure.** The Cognitive Services RP keeps working after ARM gives up; the model deployment can still reach `Succeeded` minutes later. First-time Claude provisioning on a fresh resource is the slowest combination, and times vary by region and family. **Do not re-run `azd up` blindly &mdash; it can collide with the in-flight LRO.** Check the server-side state first: run `pwsh -File scripts/verify-claude-code.ps1 -WaitForDeployment` (POSIX: `bash scripts/verify-claude-code.sh --wait-for-deployment`), which polls `az cognitiveservices account deployment list` and waits while any deployment is still `Creating`. Or check directly: `az cognitiveservices account deployment list -g <rg> -n <foundry-account>`. If state is already `Succeeded`, run `azd env refresh` to repopulate outputs and you're done. |
| Preflight: `Marketplace offer ... not found` | `CLAUDE_MODEL_NAME` is misspelled, the model isn't in the Anthropic-on-Foundry catalog yet, or Anthropic changed the plan-name convention. |
| Preflight: `Quota insufficient` (exit 6) | Requested `CLAUDE_*_CAPACITY` plus existing usage exceeds the per-region quota limit. Lower the requested capacity, free up quota by deleting unused deployments, or [purge soft-deleted accounts](#free-quota-held-by-soft-deleted-accounts) that may still be holding TPM. |
| Quota looks full but you have no live deployments (`az cognitiveservices usage list` shows `currentValue > 0`, deployment still fails with `715-123420` / `InsufficientQuota`) | **Soft-deleted Cognitive Services accounts still reserve quota for 48 h.** A previous `azd down` (or any RG / account delete) puts the AIServices account in a recoverable state that keeps holding TPM. **Fix:** list and purge them: `az cognitiveservices account list-deleted -o table` then `az cognitiveservices account purge --name <name> --location <region> --resource-group <rg>` for each. See [Free quota held by soft-deleted accounts](#free-quota-held-by-soft-deleted-accounts). |
| `401 PermissionDenied: Principal does not have access to API/Operation` intermittently &mdash; same code passes seconds later | Data-plane RBAC propagation lag on a freshly-granted role (`Cognitive Services User` / `Foundry User` / `Azure AI Developer`). The grant can take a few minutes to land on the Foundry data plane even after `az role assignment create` returns. When `ASSIGN_RBAC=true`, this kit serializes the model deployments after the role assignment so the deployment LRO absorbs the propagation wait &mdash; the first call after `azd up` should just work. If you granted the role manually *after* `azd up`, wait a minute and retry; verify the assignment with `az role assignment list --assignee <oid> --scope <foundry-account-id> -o table`. |
| `claude -p` returns `The model claude-<family>-... is not available on your foundry deployment. Try --model to switch to ...` | Your user-global `~/.claude/settings.json` has `"model"` set to a family this workspace didn't deploy. The postprovision hook writes a workspace `.claude/settings.json` with `"model"` pinned to a deployed family, which overrides the global &mdash; but if you re-ran `azd up` *before* the hook update, or your global has a per-project override, the workspace pin won't apply. Either re-run `pwsh -File scripts/configure-claude-code.ps1` to regenerate `.claude/settings.json`, pick the family explicitly via `claude -p --model <sonnet\|opus\|haiku>`, or edit `~/.claude/settings.json` to remove the `"model"` line. |
| Windows: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f60a'` printing the model's response | The Foundry sample apps happily return emoji and other non-CP1252 characters; the default Windows console (cp1252) can't render them. Either set `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"` before running, or switch the console to UTF-8 with `chcp 65001`. The Python samples already handle this gracefully, but third-party tooling may not. |
| `check_claude_quota.py` exits with `Could not resolve a subscription id ... [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` | The script falls back to `az account show` to find a subscription, but the Azure CLI isn't on `PATH` in the active shell. Either set `$env:AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<sub-id>"` or pass `--subscription <sub-id>` explicitly. |
